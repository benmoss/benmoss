### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on helping companies effectively and securely use Kubernetes
- ğŸŒ± In my spare time I'm learning ğŸ¦€Rust, for no good reason other than the terrible influence of [fasterthanlime](https://github.com/fasterthanlime) and the desire to broaden my knowledge ğŸ˜„

- You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mossity)
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
